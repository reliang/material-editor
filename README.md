# Material Manager

To implement the material manager, I used Node.js, Express.js, and React.js. I also utilized the Material UI library. This project took me some time since I didn't have a framework to start on. I spent around 6-8 hours total. I finished the features displaying existing materials on the list, selecting, adding and deleting from list, and changing the name of materials.

## How to Run

Go into project folder, open terminal and run "node app". The website will run on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
